"""Ingest a PDF deck: one page image per slide, plus the text and fingerprints
that everything downstream leans on.

A deck is one file — the PDF the instructor exported from Quarto, PowerPoint,
Keynote, Beamer or anything else. The app copies it into the deck folder and
renders each page to a PNG; the narration is written in the app, against those
pages, and lives in narration.json.

Two other things come out of the same pass:
- `slide_text`, the page's extracted words, so Claude can draft from cheap text
  instead of reading every page as an image;
- fingerprints, so a re-uploaded PDF can be matched against the previous ingest
  and the script carried onto the right slides (see slidematch).
