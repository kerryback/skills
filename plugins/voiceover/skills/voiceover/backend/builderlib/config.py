"""Central configuration.

The ElevenLabs key a user pastes in the app is stored in ~/.voiceover/.env, NOT
inside the skill directory. The skill directory is package content: installing or
updating the plugin replaces it, and a key kept there would silently vanish on
every update — leaving the person who used the paste-in-app path (rather than
exporting a shell variable) staring at the key banner again with no explanation.
Everything else durable already lives in ~/.voiceover for the same reason.

Resolution order, strongest first: a real environment variable, then
~/.voiceover/.env, then a legacy backend/.env — which is still read so an
existing install keeps working, and whose key is migrated out on first run.
