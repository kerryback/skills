"""Match a re-ingested deck against the previous ingest.

The instructor edits the PDF and reattaches it, so slides can be added, removed,
or revised in place. Narration cannot be carried over by index: inserting one
page would shift every later slide's script — and, because the MP3s and the
audio hash map are keyed by index too, its audio — while every slide still
*looked* correctly matched. This module aligns the two ingests on per-slide
content and reports, for each new slide, which old slide it came from and
whether its content changed.

Alignment is a cascade of progressively weaker evidence. Each level matches what
it can; the runs left between those matches are handed down to the next level,
so a strong match never gets crossed by a weak one:

1. `image_sha` — the rendered page is byte-identical. The slide is unchanged.
2. `text_sha` — the words are identical but the pixels are not: a chart or
   diagram edit (or a re-export that re-rasterized). Matched, flagged `edited`.
3. text similarity — the words are merely close: a slide revised in place. This
   level is what keeps a reworded slide from being paired with a deleted
   neighbour just because it landed in the same position.
4. position — nothing left to go on. Within a run bounded by matched slides,
   the k-th old slide is the k-th new one, revised. Surplus new slides are
   insertions, surplus old ones deletions.

Two shas rather than one because either alone has a blind spot: the image misses
nothing but drifts when a re-export renders identical content differently, and
the text is stable but blind to a graphics-only edit. Fingerprints are computed
in `convert._fingerprints`; the `text` used by level 3 is the page text the
caller carries over from narration.json.
