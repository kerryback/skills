"""Per-slide TTS audio generation.

Synthesizes one ElevenLabs MP3 per slide that has speaker notes, parameterized
by voice_id + model + voice settings.

Each MP3 is named for a sha of the text it speaks plus the voice signature, so
the audio directory is a content-addressed cache: a rebuild re-synthesizes only
what actually changed, and — because nothing is keyed by slide position —
inserting or reordering slides reuses every clip that still says the same thing
in the same voice.
