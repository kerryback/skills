# Voiceover Builder — API & Data Contract

Single source of truth for the backend and frontend. Both build to this.

This app turns a slide deck into a narrated MP4 video plus a transcript. It is an
instructor-only authoring tool that runs locally as a skill: the instructor
invokes it on a deck, the app opens on http://127.0.0.1:8010, and the finished
`.mp4` and `.txt` are written to the instructor's working directory. Students run
nothing — they only receive those two files. There is no student-facing app, no
chatbot, no hosting, and no in-app download.

## What a deck is

One file: the PDF the instructor exported from their slides, arriving either as a
path (the launcher, when the skill was invoked on a deck) or as a browser upload
(the Upload screen, when it wasn't). The app copies it into the deck folder
(`deck.pdf`) and renders one page image per slide.

The narration is the app's own — `narration.json` in the deck folder — because a
PDF has nowhere to keep it. Two authors write to that one copy: the instructor,
in the Narration text screen (autosaved per slide), and Claude Code, through the
narration API. Non-PDF input is refused with an instruction to export first.

## Auth model

- None. The app runs locally, launched per-deck by the instructor.

## Directory layout

```
backend/            FastAPI app (this contract's server)
frontend/           React + Vite + Tailwind SPA -> builds to frontend/dist
scripts/            skill_launch.py (start the app)

{project}/                    the instructor's project folder (VOICEOVER_OUTPUT_DIR)
  <deck>.pdf                  the deck the instructor exported (read, never written)
  <deck>.mp4                  finished narrated video (build output — the deliverable)
  <deck>.txt                  finished narration transcript (build output)
  .voiceover/                 per-project app data (DATA_DIR); no database
    decks/<deck>/             one folder per deck, named after it (the deck id)
      deck.pdf                the app's copy of the ingested PDF
      slides/slide-NNN.png    per-slide images rendered from it (1-based)
      narration.json          {"slides":[{index,title,slide_text,narration,change?}]}
      fingerprints.json       {"slides":[{index,image_sha,text_sha}]} — last ingest
      config.json             {voice_id, model, stability, similarity_boost,
                              style, use_speaker_boost, speed}
      audio/<sha>.mp3 + manifest.json
      meta.json               {id,name,state,source_type,source_path,upload_name,
                              source_mtime,build_sig,review,log,timestamps}
```
The deck folders under `.voiceover/decks` ARE the registry — the app lists decks
by scanning them and reading each `meta.json`. There is no database.

## Deck states

`loading → ready → building → built`, plus `load_failed | building_failed`, each
carrying a `log`. `ready` means the page images and the narration are in hand.
`built` means the MP4 is ready.

Staleness is computed, not stored: `store.build_signature` shas every slide's
narration plus the voice settings; `_build` stamps it into `build_sig`;
`is_stale` compares. So an edit or a settings change makes a built video stale
with no edit bookkeeping.

## Carrying the script across a new upload

A re-uploaded PDF is aligned against the previous ingest by content, never by
index — insert one page and every later slide would otherwise inherit its
neighbour's script. `slidematch.align` runs a cascade of image sha → text sha →
text similarity → position (see its module docstring), and `jobs._carry_over`
moves each surviving slide's narration onto its new index, flagging what moved:

- `change: "new"` — nothing matched it; it has no narration yet.
- `change: "edited"` — matched on weaker evidence than an identical render; it
  keeps the old script as a starting point.
- `review` (on the deck) — `{total, unchanged, edited, new, removed,
  suspect_rerender}`. `suspect_rerender` means most matches were same-words /
  different-pixels, i.e. a re-export rather than a rewrite.

Flags clear when the slide is edited (`PUT …/narration…`) or waved through
(`POST …/review/clear`); the review disappears when no flag is left.

Audio needs no equivalent: clips are named for the text they speak, so a script
that lands on a different slide brings its audio with it.

## REST API (all JSON; all under /api; no auth — local app)

- `GET  /api/projects` → `[{id,name,state,stale,files,updated_at}]`
- `POST /api/projects` `{pdf, name?, project?}` → deck summary; starts an ingest.
  `pdf` is a path to a PDF already on disk (the launcher's route). 400 if it is
  missing or not a PDF. Re-opening the same PDF reopens the same deck (id = slug
  of the filename stem); `project` re-reads into a named deck instead, for a
  re-export saved under a different filename.
- `POST /api/projects/upload` (multipart `file`) → 202; start a new deck from a
  PDF chosen in the browser — the Upload screen with no deck open, which is how a
  bare launch (no deck named) gets its slides. Deck id = slug of the filename
  stem, so the same deck reopens rather than duplicating.
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/pdf` (multipart `file`) → 202; upload into an existing
  deck. Same deck, same settings, script carried across.
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/reload` → 202; re-read the PDF from the path the deck
  was opened with. 409 for a deck whose PDF arrived by upload (no path to go back
  to) or whose path is gone.
- `GET  /api/projects/{id}` → `{id,name,state,stale,files,
  slides:[{index,title,narration,change,image_url}],config,review,log,updated_at}`
- `GET  /api/projects/{id}/narration` → `{slides:[{index,title,slide_text,
  narration,change?}],review}` — what Claude Code reads before drafting.
- `PUT  /api/projects/{id}/narration/{index}` `{narration}` → 200; one slide (the
  editor's autosave). 404 for an index this deck doesn't have.
- `PUT  /api/projects/{id}/narration` `{slides:[{index,narration}]}` → `{written}`;
  several at once (how Claude delivers a draft). Slides not named are untouched.
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/review/clear` `{indexes?}` → `{cleared}`; drop change
  flags without editing ("keep as is"). Omit `indexes` to clear all.
- `PUT  /api/projects/{id}/config` `{voice_id,model,stability,similarity_boost,style,use_speaker_boost,speed}` → 200 (all fields optional)
- `GET  /api/tts/status` → `{configured}` (is an ElevenLabs key set)
- `POST /api/tts/key` `{api_key}` → validates against ElevenLabs, persists to `~/.voiceover/.env` (outside the skill dir, so a plugin update can't wipe it), updates the live value
- `GET  /api/tts/voices` → `{configured, voices:[{voice_id,name,category}]}`
- `GET  /api/tts/voices/{voice_id}` → `{voice_id,name,category,preview_url,labels[]}` (resolve one id — the account first, then the Voice Library; 404 when no such voice)
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/build` → 202; TTS + video. 409 while loading or after a failed load.
- `GET  /api/projects/{id}/events` → SSE stream of `{stage,state,done,total,message}` for the active job
- `GET  /api/projects/{id}/slides/{file}` → PNG (slide image)
- `GET  /api/projects/{id}/video` → the rendered MP4 (served inline, Range-aware; 404 until built) — for the in-app player only

`files` (on a deck) is `{pdf, source_path, source_dir, missing, changed,
uploaded}`: `changed` means the PDF on disk has moved on since the app read it
(the instructor re-exported in place), which is what `POST …/reload` is for.

## Audio cache

`audio_gen` names each MP3 `sha(narration + voice signature).mp3` and writes
`manifest.json` mapping slide index → filename. Nothing is keyed by slide
position, so inserting or reordering slides re-synthesizes nothing, and two
slides with identical narration share a clip. Unreferenced clips are pruned after
each build.

## Output delivery (no in-app download)

On each finished build the `<deck>.mp4` and `<deck>.txt` (transcript) are
rendered directly into the instructor's project folder (`VOICEOVER_OUTPUT_DIR`,
set by the launcher to the cwd; see `store.video_path` / `store.transcript_path`).
The app plays `GET /api/projects/{id}/video` in a `<video>` tag; there is no
download button.

## Voices & models (frontend picker; backend passes through to audio_gen)

- Voices: fetched live from the account via `GET /api/tts/voices` (ElevenLabs),
  so account + cloned voices appear. Default `voice_id` is `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`
  ("Sarah"). When no `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set the picker prompts for one.
- The rest of ElevenLabs' Voice Library (~15k voices) is not listed — it is only
  browsable and auditionable on their site. The picker takes a pasted id instead
  and resolves it through `GET /api/tts/voices/{voice_id}`, showing the name,
  labels and preview clip before the instructor commits to it. Text-to-speech
  accepts a library voice directly, with no add-to-my-voices step; ElevenLabs
  files it under the account on first use, so afterwards it is in the dropdown.
- Models (`model_id`): `eleven_v3` (default, most expressive),
  `eleven_multilingual_v2` (even, understated), `eleven_turbo_v2_5` (faster),
  `eleven_flash_v2_5` (fastest). v3 is the default because the v2 family's even
  delivery reads as flat over a full narrated lecture — a model property, not an
  account-tier limit.
- Voice settings, all sent on every request (`audio_gen.VOICE_SETTING_KEYS`):
  `stability`, `similarity_boost`, `style`, `use_speaker_boost`, `speed`.
  Defaults 0.5 / 0.75 / 0.0 / true / 1.0. Ranges are 0–1 except `speed` (0.7–1.2).
- Stability is model-shaped: v3 defines three levels (0.0 Creative, 0.5 Natural,
  1.0 Robust) and the picker offers exactly those; the v2 family takes a
  continuous 0–1 slider. The API does not reject in-between values on v3, so the
  backend passes settings through unmodified rather than snapping them.

## Frontend

- React + Vite + Tailwind. Builds to `frontend/dist`; FastAPI serves it at `/`
  (SPA fallback). API calls use RELATIVE paths (`api/...`) so it works behind a
  proxy/sub-path.
- Four screens plus Generate, all in one row in the top bar, in the order things
  happen for a new deck: `Upload · Narration text · Audio settings · [Generate] ·
  Preview`. They are places, not steps: nothing is gated on anything else, and the
  app routes the instructor only twice — after an upload (→ Narration text) and on
  pressing Generate (→ Preview).
  - Upload — drop zone / picker. With a deck open it uploads into that deck and
    says what survives; with none open (a bare launch) it starts a new deck and
    also lists the decks this folder already knows. Shows a "read it again" offer
    when the PDF on disk changed since the app read it.
  - Narration text — thumbnail strip (amber dot = no narration, coloured tag =
    changed in the last upload), the slide on the left, its script in an
    autosaving textarea on the right, and the review banner above when an upload
    left flags.
  - Audio settings — voice, Voice Library lookup, model, and the read settings.
    Autosaved, debounced; no apply step.
  - Preview — the finished video, or an empty state with a Generate button.
- Both incremental paths are stated where they are used, because "will this throw
  away my work?" is the question that stops people using either: the Upload
  screen says a page that didn't change keeps its narration and its audio, and
  Generate says only slides whose narration changed are spoken again.
- The header also carries the deck name, the PDF's filename and the state pill.
  Build progress (SSE, with per-slide ticks) renders under it on whichever screen
  is showing; a failed build keeps its reason on screen until the next run.
- Opening `/` with no `?project=` is the Upload screen alone. Uploading there
  stamps `?project=<id>` into the URL, so a reload — or handing the link to
  Claude — reopens the same deck.

## Build job (backend)

1. Synthesize audio for every slide with narration, using `config.voice_id` +
   `config.model` + voice settings (ElevenLabs). Clips are content-addressed, so
   only text that is new in this voice is sent.
2. Render `video.mp4` (`video_gen.generate`): each slide's PNG shown for its
   narration length + a 1.5s pause (silent slides dwell 4s), segments normalized
   to 1920×1080/25fps and concatenated. Uses ffmpeg from the `imageio-ffmpeg`
   wheel — no system ffmpeg.
3. Write the transcript (`jobs._write_transcript`): the per-slide narration,
   snapshotted so it matches this build.
4. Outputs are already in place: both were rendered straight to
   `VOICEOVER_OUTPUT_DIR`; `jobs._announce_outputs` just reports where.
5. Stamp `build_sig` so later edits show as stale.

Nothing is rendered from source — no Quarto, no LibreOffice, no headless browser.
The slide images come from the instructor's PDF.

## Env (backend)

`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (TTS) is the only key — the app makes no LLM calls, so there
is no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `DATA_DIR` (per-project deck folders + working files;
the launcher sets `{project}/.voiceover`). Optional: `TTS_CONCURRENCY` (default
5, capped by your ElevenLabs account's concurrency limit), `VIDEO_CONCURRENCY`
(default 4), `VOICEOVER_OUTPUT_DIR` (finished MP4 + transcript destination; the
launcher sets it to the cwd).
