"""Open litdb's local web forms inside Academic Studio instead of the system browser.

Academic Studio (the VS Code build in ~/repos/academic_code) ships an extension that
coordinates with local skill apps through two files in a shared directory:

  inapp     a capability marker the extension writes on activation, containing its
            own process id. Its presence (with a live pid) means "I will open the
            tab for you" — so the launcher skips the external browser.
  app-url   the launcher writes the URL here; the extension watches the file and
            opens whatever appears in an in-editor Simple Browser tab.

Today that extension only watches ``~/.voiceover``, so litdb publishes there when
that channel is live. ``~/.academic-studio`` is checked first: it is the generic
channel a future Studio build should use, and litdb will prefer it automatically
once one exists. Nothing here is required — outside Studio no marker is live and
callers fall back to :mod:`webbrowser`, exactly as before.
