"""The whole pipeline on a real company, from the staged workbook out.

ProFrac Holding (ACDC) is the right case to pin: it lost money in four of its
last five years, carries a tax receivable agreement, operating leases, goodwill,
a mezzanine preferred and a noncontrolling interest, and has two classes of
common. Every awkward branch in the model gets used.

The assumptions here are illustrative, not a view on the company. What is under
test is that real statements flow through classification, footing, history and
the engine into both artifacts, and that the warnings say what this company's
history implies.
