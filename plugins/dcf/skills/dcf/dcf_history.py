"""Historical driver ratios, computed from a script rather than read off a page.

Two jobs.

``check_footing`` guards the classification gate. Every reported balance-sheet
line has to land in exactly one bucket, and the buckets have to add back to the
reported total. A line that is on the statement and not in the table is an
error, not an omission -- that is precisely how a real liability goes missing
from a valuation.

``historical_ratios`` computes each driver the same way the forecast does, so
that history and forecast are comparable columns of one table. Balance-sheet
items are divided by the *following* year's sales, because that is what the
model assumes they support; income-statement items use their own year. The
final year therefore carries no balance ratio, having no next year to support.

It also reports realised capex from the PP&E roll-forward, so the depreciation
rate and the capex the model implies can be checked against what the company
actually spent.
