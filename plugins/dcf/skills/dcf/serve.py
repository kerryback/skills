"""Serve the built pages for the edit-and-watch loop.

``python -m http.server`` would almost do, but it lets the browser cache, and a
cached page defeats the whole point: the reload fires and the browser serves the
stale copy back to itself. This sends ``Cache-Control: no-store`` on everything,
which is the one thing worth a file of our own.

    python serve.py ./out            # http://127.0.0.1:8765

Then rebuild whenever the numbers change:

    python build_pages.py bundle.json ./out --csv assumptions.csv --live

The ``--live`` pages poll this server once a second and reload when the file
they are looking at actually changes. Pages built without ``--live`` carry no
script at all, which is what you send someone.

One thing to expect: browsers throttle timers in a tab you are not looking at,
so a backgrounded page can take a while to notice. It catches up the moment you
switch back to it, which is when you wanted to see it anyway.

Stop it with ctrl-C. Nothing is written outside the directory you point it at,
and it listens on the loopback address only.
