"""Resolve the WRDS username portably — no hardcoding, works for any user.

The wrds library needs the username passed to `wrds.Connection(wrds_username=...)`
(it never reads it from ~/.pgpass). To keep code reusable across users, never
hardcode it — resolve it at runtime, first hit wins:

  1. $WRDS_USER environment variable (explicit override).
  2. ~/.wrds — first non-comment line, or a `WRDS_USER=<id>` line.
  3. ~/.pgpass — field 4 (username) of the line whose host contains "wrds".
     Zero extra setup: anyone who has WRDS working already has this.

Copy this function INLINE into a data-build script so the script stays
re-runnable without this file on the path, or run it as a tool:
    python wrds_username.py     # prints the resolved username
